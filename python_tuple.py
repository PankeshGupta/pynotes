atuple = ([1,2,3,'list'],"hello",123)
# here we are making a dummy tuple
# which itself contains a list

# we want to update the tuple by assignmet operator
# it should throw us an error
# which will be an type error which states the the type tuple doesnt support item assisgnment

# but if we are storing a variable or a list or a object in the tuple
# we can easily update the variable to the value which iit reffers
# or we can easily update the object
# or the list
# we caanot append anything in the tuple as well

a[0].append("new additon in list")

# it works
